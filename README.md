## How it was built

This site was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I chose this framework as a way to scrape the rust of what
I used to know about React. Gatsby also had some built in features that I enjoyed such as lazy load on images and really fast load times for content.

Adobe XD was used for all initial design mockups and to create the mountains and trees as SVGs. This was my second time using
this program and I am quite pleased with it. It pretty simple to use and let's me get the image in my head actually on a screen.
I'm sure some professional designers are able to leverage what it can do more but for my needs (and skill level) it works.

## Updating

I normally try to come in and update it as new projects are completed or if some new design tweak is needed. If you have
any recomendations for improvements (UX, Accessibility, etc) please add an issue
[here!](https://github.com/Brallen/brallen.github.io/issues) and I'll look into adding that to the site.
